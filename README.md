# MultiVariableCalculus
A project for Calc 3 related classes.


## `Vectors` Package
The `Vectors` package contains several immutable classes related to the basic storage of objects in 3D space,
including `Line`, `Plane`, `Point`, and `Vector`.  These classes store these concepts in an easy to use way.
All of these use `Number` to store their values, rather than `double` or other floating point values. 

### `Number`
The `Number` class is a wrapper class for `BigDecimal` that provides an exact way to store values,
without some of the disadvantages of `BigDecimal`.
It is used throughout the program to store values.

## `Functions` Package
The `Functions` package provides a bunch of classes related to storing and parsing functions.
These functions represent what would normally be called a function in mathematics.
