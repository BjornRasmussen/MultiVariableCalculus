This folder contains classes that represent 3D vectors and relevant methods related to vectors.

## üìê `Angle.java`

    Returns true if the point p is part of this plane.
    
    * `public boolean contains(Line l)`  
    Returns true if every point on the line is contained in the plane.

    Initializes the point with the x, y, and z coordinates entered.
    
* Methods
    
    * `public double getX()`  
    Returns the x coordinate of the point.
    
    * `public double getY()`  
    Returns the y coordinate of the point.
    
    * `public double getZ()`  
    Returns the z coordinate of the point.
    
    * `public boolean equals(Point other)`
    Returns true if the x, y, and z coordinates of the
    two points are practically equal to each other.

## üî∫ `Triangle.java`  

`Immutable`  
This class provides a simple way to store a triangle in 3D space.
This class encapsulates three points (`Point.java`) to store the triangle.


* Constructors
    
    * `public Triangle (Point p1, Point p2, Point p3)`  
    Initializes the Triangle with the three points entered.
    These points must form a valid triangle.
    
    * `public Triangle (Point[] points)`  
    Initializes the Triangle with the first three
    points in the input array.
    These points must form a valid triangle.
    
    * `public Triangle (Vector u, Vector v)`
    Initializes the Triangle with the two vectors entered.
    This is done by placing the first point at `(0,0,0)`,
    placing the second point at `u`, and the third at `v`.  
    Useful when you don't care about where the triangle is located,
    only about the dimensions of the triangle.
    
* Methods
    
    * `public Point[] getPoints()`  
    Returns an array of length 3 that contains the
    three points of the triangle.

    Useful for easier printing of the process of which the triangle's area
    was found.
    
    * `public String toString()`  
    Returns a String that is a 
    human readable text version of the triangle.
    
    * `public Triangle clone()`  
    Returns a copy of the triangle at a new place in memory.
    
## ‚Üó `Vector.java`

`Immutable`  
This class provides a way to store a vector.
It encapsulates an `X`, `Y`, and `Z` that represent the change in position of the vector.

* Constructors

    * `public Vector(double x, double y)`  
    Initializes the vector with the `X` and `Y` values entered.
    The `Z` value of the vector is initialized to `0.0`.

    * `public Vector (Point p1, Point p2)`
    Initializes the vector to the vector
    that starts at `p1` and ends at `p2`.
    For example, an input of  `p1 = (0,0,1)`, `(p2 = 1,-1,2)`
    would initialize the vector to `<1, -1, 1>`.

    of this vector and `other`.
    
    `public boolean isPerpendicularTo(Vector other)`  
    Returns true if this vector is perpendicular to `other`.
    This is true when the dot product is `0`,
    and indicates that the angle between this vector and `other` is 90 degrees.
    
    `public boolean isParallelTo(Vector other)`  
    Returns true if this vector is parallel to `other`.
    This is true when the cross product of this vector and `other`

    `public Vector clone()`  
    Returns a copy of this vector at a new place in memory.
    
    `public double getX()`
